## 1. Signal Classification Hierarchy

### Integral (Primary) Signals
Primary signals are direct market indicators that represent fundamental economic activity or raw data points. These signals:
- Are closest to the source of economic activity
- Have minimal processing or manipulation
- Often provide early warning indicators of market changes

Examples:
- Raw material prices and inventory levels
- Construction permit applications
- Factory utilization rates
- Job posting volumes
- Patent applications
- Energy consumption patterns
- Shipping container volume

### Derivative (Secondary) Signals
Secondary signals are derived from primary signals through analysis, aggregation, or transformation. These signals:
- Build upon primary signals
- Require processing or calculation
- May lag behind primary signals

Examples:
- Financial statement metrics
- Market share calculations
- Industry concentration ratios
- Stock price movements
- Analyst consensus estimates
- Credit ratings
- ESG scores

## 2. Signal Classification Framework

### Level 0 - Raw Economic Activity
- Direct measurements of economic actions
- No processing or interpretation required
- Example: Number of housing starts

### Level 1 - Simple Aggregation
- Basic combination of raw data points
- Minimal mathematical transformation
- Example: Monthly construction spending totals

### Level 2 - Derived Metrics
- Calculated from Level 0 or Level 1 signals
- Involves mathematical operations or ratios
- Example: Year-over-year growth rates

### Level 3 - Complex Derivatives
- Multiple input signals required
- Sophisticated calculations or modeling
- Example: Market share percentages

### Level 4 - Synthetic Indicators
- Highly processed composite signals
- Multiple layers of derivation
- Example: Credit default risk scores

## 3. Early Indicator Identification

### Key Principles
1. Focus on Level 0 and Level 1 signals
2. Look for signals with direct economic impact
3. Identify signals with historical predictive power
4. Monitor signals with low market attention

### Signal Analysis Process
1. Map the value chain for your investment target
2. Identify Level 0 signals at each value chain step
3. Track correlation between signal levels
4. Monitor signal propagation patterns
5. Document lead/lag relationships

### Advantages of Lower Level Signals
- Earlier detection of market changes
- Less affected by market noise
- More direct connection to economic activity
- Reduced impact from financial engineering
- Greater potential for unique insights
