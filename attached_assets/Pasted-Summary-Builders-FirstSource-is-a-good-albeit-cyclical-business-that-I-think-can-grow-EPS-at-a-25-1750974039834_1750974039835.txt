Summary: Builders FirstSource is a good (albeit cyclical) business that I think can grow EPS at a 25% CAGR over the 
next couple of years following a 47% EBITDA decline and 38% EPS decline over the last two years. Today, it trades at 
12.5x P/E on what I believe to be depressed earnings. Assuming a 12.5x exit P/E, I estimate a 3-year double vs. a 36% 
short-term downside assuming a trough 10x multiple on my bear case earnings. There is potential upside near-term 
if we see any lumber cost inflation from today’s levels. Given an attractive upside/downside today but also a real 
risk that Trump-driven stagflation overshoots near-term, I’d like to start a small position in the growth EBB today 
but would be more eager to add below $105.
1. Builder’s FirstSource is a good business, primarily because of their roll up model and amazing management 
team. The good: regional scale, capital-light, high returns on capital, secular mix/margin shift upward due to 
labor shortages in construction, amazing culture/management. The bad: 50% of sales are commodity, not 
much pricing power, cyclically exposed to housing market and lumber prices. But the good seems to 
outweigh the bad as BLDR has done a relative 600 over the L10Y and a relative 185 over the L4Y, even as 
housing starts were declining.
2. Organic volumes are tied to housing – with 70% tied to single family starts, 10% tied to multi-family starts, 
and 20% tied to repair & remodel. I estimate negative 2-3% organic volumes in 2025 and ~3% volume
growth thereafter as I do expect starts to rebound in 2026 albeit not aggressively (expectation of 1.3M 
starts in 2025 to 1.45M in 2028). Positive mix shift toward value-add products (+1000bps over consolidated 
margins) should drive at least 50bps of annual margin expansion.
3. This is not a business with pricing power – pricing is driven primarily by lumber costs. However, the positive 
is that all distributors price for a 20% gross margin, so higher lumber prices means higher gross dollars. Since 
2
2022, lumber prices have normalized around $400, which has already had a negative impact on earnings. I 
project lumber prices moving to $425 in my base case and staying flat at $400 in my bear case.
4. Margin expansion is primarily by operating leverage but also by the % of sales that are value add vs. 
commodity. Over the next 3 years, I expect EBITDA margins to expand ~250bps from 12% to 14.7% (est. 25% 
incrementals).
5. I think the most important growth driver for both earnings and the stock will be delivering cash and allocating 
capital, which is BLDR’s superpower. Over the next 3 years, I expect them to deliver 3-4% inorganic growth 
and buy back 6-7% of their shares annually.
6. BLDR is one of those special companies whose multiple is extremely volatile but whose fundamentals are 
less cyclical than perceived. Thus, we want to buy the stock when the stock is trading below mid-cycle. At the 
current moment, it is trading at a mid-cycle valuation (12.5x P/E) but on what I believe to be depressed 
earnings (both sales and margins). While I think in a worst-case scenario, there can still be 35-40% downside 
from here, my long-term base case implies a 3-year double.
