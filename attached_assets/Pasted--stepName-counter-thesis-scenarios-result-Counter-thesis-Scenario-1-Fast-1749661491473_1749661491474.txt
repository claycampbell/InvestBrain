    "Counter-thesis Scenario 1 – Faster-than-expected Russian/Belarusian supply return:  If sanctions are relaxed or alternative export routes are found, global potash capacity could normalize quickly.  A 5-10 % YoY drop in Nutrien’s Xpressfeed-reported EPS, accompanied by flat REVENUE, would confirm price pressure from excess supply and undermine the mid-cycle price floor assumption.",
    "Counter-thesis Scenario 2 – North-American ammonia build-out triggers margin collapse:  Multiple new plants (including Nutrien’s proposed US$2 B facility) could come on line simultaneously.  Should FactSet data show NTR’s PRICE underperforming peers in the Materials SECTOR while Xpressfeed EPS compression exceeds −15 % YoY, it would indicate that incremental volumes are being sold at structurally lower spreads.",
    "Counter-thesis Scenario 3 – Capital allocation mis-steps dilute shareholder value:  If Nutrien accelerates capex before commodity prices recover, free cash flow may tighten.  An increase in Xpressfeed REVENUE without a commensurate rise in EPS (margin squeeze) plus stagnant FactSet MARKET_VALUE would signal that growth spending is not translating to value creation.",
    "Counter-thesis Scenario 4 – Demand disappointment in key importing regions:  Prolonged inventory destocking in Brazil/India/China would leave realized potash prices closer to the low end of the range.  A sequential decline in Xpressfeed REVENUE and EPS for two consecutive FILING_DATE periods, despite industry supply constraints, would confirm demand-side weakness.",
    "Counter-thesis Scenario 5 – Erosion of management credibility leads to valuation de-rating:  Continued guidance misses or opaque disclosure could cause the market to apply a lower multiple.  Observation: if FactSet PRICE falls while Xpressfeed EPS remains stable, indicating multiple compression, investor trust—not fundamentals—may be the driver."

  "result": "Monitoring Plan for Nutrien (Ticker: NTR)\n\n1. Objective\n   Continuously assess whether Nutrien’s fundamentals and valuation still justify an investment given (i) mid-cycle potash pricing, (ii) elevated but normalising ammonia/nitrogen prices, and (iii) concerns around management’s capital-allocation discipline.\n\n2. Key Metrics & Data Pulls (all fields are directly available from Xpressfeed or FactSet)\n   A. Profitability Momentum  \n      • Xpressfeed.FILING_DATE, Xpressfeed.EPS  – capture every new quarterly filing; focus on YoY and QoQ change.  \n      • Xpressfeed.REVENUE – same cadence; gauge volume/price contribution.  \n      Query template:  \n      SELECT Ticker, FSYM_ID, FILING_DATE, EPS, REVENUE  \n      FROM   Xpressfeed  \n      WHERE  Ticker = 'NTR'  \n      ORDER  BY FILING_DATE DESC  \n      LIMIT  8;\n\n   B. Valuation & Market Signal  \n      • FactSet.PRICE (daily)  \n      • Xpressfeed.EPS (trailing-12-month sum of last 4 filings)  \n      Derived: TTM P/E = FactSet.PRICE ÷ TTM EPS.  \n      • FactSet.MARKET_VALUE (daily) to track how the market capitalises announced capex plans.  \n      Query template:  \n      SELECT Ticker, ENTITY_ID, PRICE, MARKET_VALUE  \n      FROM   FactSet  \n      WHERE  Ticker = 'NTR';\n\n3. Frequency & Alert Logic\n   • Quarterly (immediately after each new Xpressfeed.FILING_DATE):  \n     – Flag if EPS declines >10% QoQ while REVENUE is flat/up (possible margin compression from lower realised fertiliser prices).  \n     – Flag if announced capex (qualitatively from MD&A) coincides with falling EPS.  \n   • Weekly:  \n     – Re-compute TTM P/E. If it rises >25% above the 3-year median, review thesis that shares already price in a rebound.  \n     – Track FactSet.MARKET_VALUE changes versus REVENUE trend; rapid market-cap expansion without revenue growth may indicate over-optimism about new capacity.  \n\n4. Decision Triggers\n   • Consider trimming/exit if two consecutive quarters show EPS down >10% QoQ AND TTM P/E is >20×.  \n   • Consider adding/maintaining if EPS stabilises YoY and TTM P/E falls below 12× despite capacity additions being delayed.\n\n5. Storage & Review\n   • Store each pull (date-stamped) in an internal dashboard; visualise EPS vs PRICE and REVENUE vs MARKET_VALUE.  \n   • Formal review call one week after every new FILING_DATE data drop.",
