Monitoring Plan for Nutrien (Ticker: NTR)

1. Objective
   Continuously assess whether Nutrien’s fundamentals and valuation still justify an investment given (i) mid-cycle potash pricing, (ii) elevated but normalising ammonia/nitrogen prices, and (iii) concerns around management’s capital-allocation discipline.

2. Key Metrics & Data Pulls (all fields are directly available from Xpressfeed or FactSet)
   A. Profitability Momentum  
      • Xpressfeed.FILING_DATE, Xpressfeed.EPS  – capture every new quarterly filing; focus on YoY and QoQ change.  
      • Xpressfeed.REVENUE – same cadence; gauge volume/price contribution.  
      Query template:  
      SELECT Ticker, FSYM_ID, FILING_DATE, EPS, REVENUE  
      FROM   Xpressfeed  
      WHERE  Ticker = 'NTR'  
      ORDER  BY FILING_DATE DESC  
      LIMIT  8;

   B. Valuation & Market Signal  
      • FactSet.PRICE (daily)  
      • Xpressfeed.EPS (trailing-12-month sum of last 4 filings)  
      Derived: TTM P/E = FactSet.PRICE ÷ TTM EPS.  
      • FactSet.MARKET_VALUE (daily) to track how the market capitalises announced capex plans.  
      Query template:  
      SELECT Ticker, ENTITY_ID, PRICE, MARKET_VALUE  
      FROM   FactSet  
      WHERE  Ticker = 'NTR';

3. Frequency & Alert Logic
   • Quarterly (immediately after each new Xpressfeed.FILING_DATE):  
     – Flag if EPS declines >10% QoQ while REVENUE is flat/up (possible margin compression from lower realised fertiliser prices).  
     – Flag if announced capex (qualitatively from MD&A) coincides with falling EPS.  
   • Weekly:  
     – Re-compute TTM P/E. If it rises >25% above the 3-year median, review thesis that shares already price in a rebound.  
     – Track FactSet.MARKET_VALUE changes versus REVENUE trend; rapid market-cap expansion without revenue growth may indicate over-optimism about new capacity.  

4. Decision Triggers
   • Consider trimming/exit if two consecutive quarters show EPS down >10% QoQ AND TTM P/E is >20×.  
   • Consider adding/maintaining if EPS stabilises YoY and TTM P/E falls below 12× despite capacity additions being delayed.

5. Storage & Review
   • Store each pull (date-stamped) in an internal dashboard; visualise EPS vs PRICE and REVENUE vs MARKET_VALUE.  
   • Formal review call one week after every new FILING_DATE data drop.
