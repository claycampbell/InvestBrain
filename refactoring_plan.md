# Code Refactoring Plan: Centralized Architecture

## Completed Steps
âœ“ Created core/llm_manager.py - Centralized LLM operations
âœ“ Created core/analysis_engine.py - Business logic orchestration  
âœ“ Created core/data_manager.py - Data access and external services
âœ“ Updated routes.py imports to use centralized architecture
âœ“ Refactored main analyze endpoint to use AnalysisEngine
âœ“ Updated significance mapping and evaluation endpoints

## Remaining Steps

### 1. Service Consolidation
- [ ] Migrate remaining routes to use centralized architecture
- [ ] Update data source endpoints to use DataManager
- [ ] Consolidate simulation and backtesting services

### 2. Legacy Service Cleanup
- [ ] Identify unused legacy services
- [ ] Remove redundant service files
- [ ] Update service dependencies

### 3. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all major endpoints with new architecture
- [ ] Verify data flow through centralized components
- [ ] Validate performance and reliability

## Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: LLM, Analysis, and Data operations clearly separated
- **Centralized Monitoring**: All AI calls tracked through LLMManager
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified approach across all services
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend functionality
- **Testing**: Simplified mocking and testing strategies

## Migration Status
- Main analysis workflow: âœ“ Migrated
- Significance analysis: âœ“ Migrated
- Thesis evaluation: âœ“ Migrated
- Data operations: âœ“ Migrated
- Remaining endpoints: ðŸ”„ In Progress
