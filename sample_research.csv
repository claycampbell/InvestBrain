Investment Analysis
"Investment Thesis: BUY CARR (99% 3-yr base case return): a historically starved business with leading HVAC market share, now regaining its focus on growth. I view Carrier as a fundamentally undervalued business trading at trough valuations and trough volumes. As management executes on its 3-year supply chain cost-out/reinvestment plan and deleverages, I project a 90% base case return. Price Target: $65 (current: $43). Expected Return: 90% over 3 years. Key risks include high leverage and cyclical exposure."
