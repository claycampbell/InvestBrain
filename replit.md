# Investment Thesis Intelligence System

## Overview

This is a sophisticated Flask-based investment thesis analysis platform that leverages AI (Azure OpenAI) to analyze investment research, extract actionable signals, and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. The system processes investment theses through natural language processing, generates structured monitoring plans, and integrates with external financial data sources.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask 3.1.1 with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ for ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (production) with SQLite fallback (development)
- **AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI GPT models for thesis analysis and signal extraction
- **External APIs**: FactSet and Xpressfeed for financial data (with intelligent fallbacks)
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server on Replit with autoscaling

### Frontend Architecture
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3+ with custom dark/light theme support
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with Chart.js/ApexCharts for data visualization
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templating with responsive design
- **Real-time Updates**: AJAX-based monitoring dashboard with auto-refresh

## Key Components

### Core Services
1. **ThesisAnalyzer**: AI-powered investment thesis decomposition
2. **SignalClassifier**: 6-level signal classification system (Level 0-5)
3. **ChainedAnalysisService**: Sequential prompt-based analysis for reliability
4. **MonitoringService**: Real-time thesis performance tracking
5. **BacktestingService**: Historical validation against market scenarios
6. **SimulationService**: Monte Carlo-style forward-looking projections

### Data Management
- **DocumentProcessor**: PDF, Excel, CSV research document analysis
- **DataAdapter**: Unified interface to multiple financial data sources
- **MetricSelector**: Intelligent metric selection based on thesis characteristics
- **DataRegistry**: Centralized data source prioritization and caching

### Intelligence Features
- **AdvancedAnalyticsService**: Multi-dimensional thesis performance scoring
- **AlternativeCompanyService**: AI-powered discovery of comparable investments
- **ThesisEvaluator**: 8-dimension research strength assessment
- **MarketSentimentService**: Real-time sentiment analysis integration

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: User submits thesis text + optional research documents
2. **AI Analysis**: Chained prompts extract core claims, assumptions, and causal chains
3. **Signal Generation**: 6-level classification from raw data to complex derived metrics
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Automated data pull schedules and alert thresholds
5. **Real-time Tracking**: Continuous signal monitoring with performance scoring
6. **Validation**: Backtesting against historical scenarios and forward simulation
